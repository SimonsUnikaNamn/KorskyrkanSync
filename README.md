# Sync korskyrkan register with contacts

## requirements
Python 2.7

[mdbtools](https://github.com/mdbtools/mdbtools)


## How it works

Open the `sync_settings.json` file and change the `file_path` to wherever your `.mdb` file is located.

It will then convert the mdb to a csv which can be imported into google contacts.
